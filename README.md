News feather
================

About
----------------
The News Feather or News Feather (is it better with or without the 'The') is a news aggregator site that displays all the recent news from sources (i.e. CNN, Wired, TC, etc.).

The site was developed by one person, me, because I wanted it to help me learn Python web development and using the lightweight Flask framework.

Technologies Used
----------------
As stated above, I used Python for the main guts of the project and also Flask.
Flask is quite easy to install. You need to set up a virtual env. by using the <tt>virtualenv</tt> command, and then install Flask. To get Flask use <tt>pip install flask</tt>.
To see a better explanation of the installation visit the official Flask Docs - http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/

License
----------------
News Feather is under the Apache License Version 2.0 - For more information visit the <tt>LICENSE.md</tt> file.

GLHF!
